# Fully Sufficient Old World

I enjoy my sandbox being just ONE big, beautiful, populous sandbox, instead of 4-5 _different sandbox sessions_. I just want my islands to be rich, lively, and most importantly - _self-sufficient!_ - even if it means fishing for lobsters in The Queen's private pool.

## Features
